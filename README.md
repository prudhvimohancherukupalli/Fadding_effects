# Fadding_effects

In Fadding there 4 types
1.FadeIn 
2.FadeOut
3.FadeToggel
4.FadeTo

syntax
Fade**(1000) here 1000 = 1sec  , this will appilicable to all Fade effects execept FadeTo
in FadeTo it wil be as FadeTo(1000,0.25) , here 1000 =1sec and 0.25 is upto values

all the above values not default values . they all can change according to our requirements
but without UPTO value we cant use FadeTO event.
